           <p style="margin-top:-300px;margin-left:25%";><strong>SAROJINI NAIDU</strong><br><br>Sarojini Naidu(1879–1949), famously known as the "Nightingale of India," was a distinguished Indian poet, political activist, and a key figure in the Indian independence movement. Born in Hyderabad into a Bengali family, she was educated in India and England, attending Girton College, Cambridge, and ing's College London. Her literary talent emerged early, and she became renowned for her poetry, which combined vivid imagery and lyrical beauty, with themes ranging from patriotism to tragedy. Her poem "In the Bazaars of Hyderabad" remains highly celebrated.

Naidu's political career was equally remarkable. She was deeply involved in the struggle against British colonial rule, aligning closely with Mahatma Gandhi and his principles of nonviolent resistance. She actively participated in major movements such as the Civil Disobedience Movement, the Salt Satyagraha, and the Quit India Movement, enduring imprisonment multiple times for her activism. In 1925, she made history as the first Indian woman to become president of the Indian National Congress, a testament to her leadership and dedication to the cause of freedom.

Beyond politics, Sarojini Naidu was a passionate advocate for women's rights and social reform. She worked tirelessly to improve women's education and participation in public life, helping to establish women's organizations and campaigning against social injustices like child marriage. After India gained independence in 1947, she was appointed the first female governor of the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh), marking another pioneering achievement in Indian history.

Sarojini Naidu's legacy is that of a poet who gave voice to India's cultural heritage and a fearless leader who championed both national independence and gender equality. Her life and work continue to inspire generations in India and beyond.</p>

              <p style="margin-top:-300px;margin-left:25%";><strong>NICK VUJICIC</strong><br><br>Nick Vujicic is an Australian-American motivational speaker, author, and evangelist who has inspired millions worldwide through his story of overcoming extreme physical adversity. Born in Melbourne in 1982 with tetra-amelia syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by the absence of all four limbs, Nick faced immense challenges from the very beginning. Despite his physical limitations, he learned to adapt, using his small foot—affectionately called his “chicken drumstick”—to write, type, swim, and perform many daily tasks that most people take for granted[3][5].Nick’s early life was marked by significant emotional struggles, including bullying and depression. At age ten, he attempted suicide, feeling hopeless about his future. However, a turning point came when his mother showed him a newspaper article about a man living with a severe disability, which inspired Nick to embrace his own life and see his challenges as opportunities to help others

Growing up, Nick struggled with depression and bullying, at one point even contemplating suicide at the age of ten[1][2][5]. However, a turning point came when he realized he was not alone in his struggles and that his life could have purpose and meaning. With the support of his family and a deep Christian faith, Nick embraced his uniqueness and began focusing on what he could achieve rather than what he could not[5][6].

By his late teens, Nick was already sharing his story at schools and churches. At 19, he founded the non-profit organization Life Without Limbs, dedicated to spreading hope and helping others with disabilities[5]. He later established his own motivational speaking company, Attitude Is Altitude, and has since traveled to over 54 countries, addressing audiences of thousands and reaching an estimated 400 million people through his outreach efforts[5].

Nick is also a successful author, with books such as "Life Without Limits," "Unstoppable," and "Stand Strong," which have been translated into multiple languages[4][5]. His life is a testament to resilience, gratitude, and the power of a positive attitude, inspiring countless individuals to overcome their own obstacles and pursue their dreams.

<p style="margin-top:-300px;margin-left:25%";><strong>A.P.J Abdul Kalam</strong><br><br>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, was one of India’s most respected scientists and the 11th President of India (2002–2007)[3][6]. Coming from a humble background, Kalam’s early life was marked by perseverance and a deep commitment to education, even selling newspapers as a child to support his family and studies[7]. He graduated in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology, which paved the way for his remarkable career in science and technology[3][5].Luther grew increasingly critical of the Roman Catholic Church, particularly its practice of selling indulgences, which he viewed as corrupt and misleading. In 1517, he authored the Ninety-five Theses, a document challenging these practices and calling for reform. While it is debated whether he physically nailed the theses to the church door in Wittenberg, the publication sparked widespread debate across Europe thanks to the printing press.

His theological breakthrough centered on the doctrine of justification by faith alone, asserting that salvation is a gift from God, not earned by works or church rituals. Luther also challenged the authority of the Pope and church hierarchy, promoting the idea of the "priesthood of all believers"—that all Christians have direct access to God through faith

Kalam played a pivotal role in India’s space and defense programs. At ISRO, he was the project director of SLV-III, which successfully launched India’s first satellite, Rohini, into orbit in 1980[3][5][7]. He later led the development of India’s indigenous missile systems, including Agni and Prithvi, earning him the title "Missile Man of India"[4][5][7]. As Chief Scientific Adviser to the Prime Minister, he was instrumental in India’s 1998 Pokhran-II nuclear tests, establishing India as a nuclear power[7][8].

In 2002, Kalam was elected President of India, widely admired as the "People’s President" for his approachable nature and focus on youth empowerment[2][6]. He advocated for Vision 2020, aiming to transform India into a developed nation through technology and education[8][10]. After his presidency, he continued to inspire as a teacher and author, emphasizing the importance of dreaming big and serving the nation[1][6].

Dr. Kalam received numerous honors, including the Bharat Ratna, India’s highest civilian award[3][7][8]. He passed away on July 27, 2015, but remains a lasting symbol of scientific excellence, integrity, and inspiration for generations[3][7].

        <p style="margin-top:-300px;margin-left:25%";> <strong>Martin Luther</strong><br><br>**Martin Luther** (1483–1546) was a German priest, theologian, and former Augustinian monk who became the central figure of the Protestant Reformation[1][2][5]. Born in Eisleben, Saxony, Luther originally studied law but experienced a religious conversion after surviving a thunderstorm, leading him to join a monastery in 1505[6][8]. He was ordained in 1507 and later became a professor of biblical studies at the University of Wittenberg[5].

Luther grew increasingly troubled by the practices of the Roman Catholic Church, particularly the sale of indulgences, which promised forgiveness of sins in exchange for money[5][6][7]. In 1517, he famously challenged these practices by writing his *Ninety-five Theses*, which he reportedly posted on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg. This act sparked intense debate and is widely regarded as the catalyst for the Reformation[1][5][6].

Luther’s core theological insight was the doctrine of **justification by faith alone**—the belief that salvation is a gift from God, not something earned through good works or church rituals[5][8]. His refusal to recant his writings led to his excommunication by Pope Leo X in 1521 and condemnation as an outlaw by Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms[1][5][7].

Protected by the Elector of Saxony, Luther spent time in hiding at Wartburg Castle, where he translated the Bible into German. This translation made the scriptures accessible to ordinary people and became a milestone in the development of the German language[5][6].

Luther married Katharina von Bora, a former nun, in 1525, and they had six children[2][5][6]. His break with Rome resulted in the formation of the Lutheran Church, and his teachings laid the groundwork for various Protestant denominations[2][5][7]. Luther’s writings, hymns, and reforms permanently transformed Western Christianity and European society[1][2][5].

<p style="margin-top:-300px;margin-left:25%" text-align: justify;><strong>MOTHER TERESA</strong><br><br>Mother Teresa, born **Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu** on August 26, 1910, in Skopje (then part of the Ottoman Empire), became one of the most recognized symbols of compassion in the 20th century. Raised in a devout Catholic family, she joined the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland at age 18 and soon moved to India, where she would spend most of her life[2][5]. In 1950, she founded the **Missionaries of Charity** in Kolkata (Calcutta), a religious congregation dedicated to serving "the poorest of the poor." The order grew rapidly, eventually operating in over 130 countries with thousands of nuns and lay volunteers, running homes for the dying, orphanages, leprosy centers, and schools[2][3][6].

Mother Teresa’s work focused on providing dignity and care for society’s most marginalized, regardless of background or faith. She opened the first **Home for the Dying** (Nirmal Hriday) in Kolkata, offering compassion and comfort to the terminally ill[3][4]. Her humanitarian efforts earned her numerous accolades, including the **Nobel Peace Prize** in 1979, the Bharat Ratna (India’s highest civilian honor), the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize, and the Ramon Magsaysay Peace Prize[1][2][5][8].

Despite facing criticism for her strict Catholic views and the conditions in some of her homes, Mother Teresa remained steadfast in her mission. She spoke out against abortion, divorce, and contraception, reflecting her conservative beliefs[2][5][8]. She continued her work despite declining health, stepping down as head of the Missionaries of Charity in 1997, the same year she died in Kolkata on September 5In 2002, Kalam was elected President of India, widely admired as the "People’s President" for his approachable nature and focus on youth empowerment[2][6]. He advocated for Vision 2020, aiming to transform India into a developed nation through technology and education[8][10]. After his presidency, he continued to inspire as a teacher and author, emphasizing the importance of dreaming big and serving the nation.

Mother Teresa was canonized as **Saint Teresa of Calcutta** in 2016, and her legacy endures as a global icon of selfless service and compassion.
